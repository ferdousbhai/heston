 * An evidence card is one quoted passage from a page, attached to a symbol by a member's own

 * under a name is still sentences somebody's source actually contains.
 *
 * Every bound below is a rendering envelope for untrusted text rather than a research limit:
 * the card is read in a list beside the runway, and prose that overruns its measure is the one
 * thing a reader cannot correct for.
