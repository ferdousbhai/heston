 * Renders `MarketScreen` against the shared fixture snapshot. `symbol` is a convenience

 * `tickers` array applies — the override if the caller passed one, else the fixture's —
 * so a test that only cares which row starts selected doesn't repeat that lookup itself.
 * This lives outside `./market` (a plain data module several node-environment tests
 * import) because pulling in React Testing Library there would drag a DOM renderer into
 * suites that never touch jsdom.
